# The Silence of the Las Vegas Strip
On March 31 Las Vegas shut down its strip due to the **COVID-19** outbreak. Stevie Sisolak, the Nevada governor ordered a shut down of all *non-essential businesses*. This is the first time the strip has been shut down since (1963) the assassination of JFK.

> The NVA states that one in three jobs in Vegas is connected to the tourism industry which brings in about $20 billion annually.

> No other state depends on tourism as Nevada does.
